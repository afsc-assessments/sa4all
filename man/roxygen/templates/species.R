#' @param species A vector of character strings providing species names for
#' all species included in the stock assessment. Typically, there will only
#' be one species, but this template can accommodate a species complex as well.
#' Each species should be capitalized as you would like to see it used in the middle
#' of a sentence. For example,
#' \code{"Pacific Hake"} is used in the stock assessment of hake;
#' not \code{"pacific hake"} because Pacific Hake is the preferred name, not
#' pacific hake. The text can be called in the document using spp for the
#' form to be used in the middle of a sentence and Spp when placed at the
#' beginning of a sentence.
