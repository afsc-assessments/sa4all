#' @param authors A vector of author names. For example,
#' \code{"John R. Doe"} without first name first. The middle
#' initial or name is optional. Entries must exactly match
#' those used in the \code{data-raw\authors.csv} file.
#' If you need additional authors added to this file
#' please contact the package maintainers or add them to the
#' \code{.csv} file and run the R script also found in that
#' folder prior to submitting a pull request. Following this
#' workflow ensures that the author's address is also added.
