### \acrlong{s-wcgbt}

The \Gls{s-wcgbt} is based on a random-grid design;
covering the coastal waters from a depth of 55 m to 1,280 m [@bradburn_2003_2011].
This design generally uses four industry-chartered vessels per year assigned to a roughly equal number of randomly selected grid cells and divided into two 'passes' of the coast that are executed from north to south.
Two vessels fish during each pass, which are conducted from late May to early October each year.
This design therefore incorporates both vessel-to-vessel differences in catchability,
as well as variance associated with selecting a relatively small number (~700) of possible cells from a very large set of possible cells spread from the Mexican to the Canadian borders.
