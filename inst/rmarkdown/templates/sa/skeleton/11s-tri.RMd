### \acrlong{s-tri}

The \gls{s-tri} was first conducted by the \gls{afsc} in 1977 and spanned the time-frame from 1977-2004.
The survey's design and sampling methods are most recently described in Weinberg et al. [-@weinberg_2001_2002].
Its basic design was a series of equally-spaced east to west transects from which searches for tows in a specific depth range were initiated.
The survey design has changed slightly over time.
In general, all of the surveys were conducted in the mid-summer through early fall.
The 1977 survey was conducted from early July through late September.
The surveys from 1980 through 1989 ran from mid-July to late September.
The 1992 survey spanned from mid-July through early October.
The 1995 survey was conducted from early June to late August.
The 1998 survey ran from early June through early August.
Finally, the 2001 and 2004 surveys were conducted in May-July.

Haul depths ranged from 91-457 m during the 1977 survey with no hauls shallower than 91 m.
The surveys in 1980, 1983, and 1986 covered the West Coast south to $36.8^\circ$ N latitude and a depth range of 55-366 m.
The surveys in 1989 and 1992 covered the same depth range but extended the southern range to $34.5^\circ$ N (near Point Conception).
From 1995 through 2004, the surveys covered the depth range 55-500 m and surveyed south to $34.5^\circ$ N.
In the final year of the \gls{s-tri} series, 2004, the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fram} conducted the survey and followed very similar protocols as the \gls{afsc}.
Due to haul performance issues and differences in sampling depths, the 1977 are omitted from analysis.
